# Paradise Nursery Web Application

This project is a web application for Paradise Nursery, a fictional plant store. It allows users to browse plants, learn about their properties, and add them to a cart for purchase.

## Project Overview

This project was forked from the `ibm-developer-skills-network` (https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/e-plantShopping) and has been significantly enhanced with new features and functionalities. The original template provided a basic React setup, and this version adds a robust set of features to create a more complete and interactive user experience.

## Features

- **Plant Catalog:** Browse a variety of plants categorized by type (e.g., Air Purifying, Medicinal, Aromatic).
- **Plant Details:** View detailed information about each plant, including its description, image, and cost.
- **Shopping Cart:** Add plants to a shopping cart and manage the quantity of each item.
- **Modern React Practices:** Built using functional components and React Hooks for efficient state management and component logic. (Mention specific hooks you used, e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`).
- **State Management:** Implements Redux for centralized state management, ensuring data consistency across components.
